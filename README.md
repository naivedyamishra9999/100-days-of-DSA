🚀 100 Days of Code – Data Structures & Algorithms (Semester 2)
📌 Overview

This repository documents my 100 Days of Code journey focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) during Semester 2 of my undergraduate studies.
The goal of this challenge is to build strong problem-solving skills, improve logical thinking, and gain a solid foundation in core DSA concepts through consistent daily practice.

🎯 Objectives

Develop a disciplined daily coding habit

Master fundamental and intermediate DSA concepts

Improve time & space complexity analysis

Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming

Strengthen C/C++ programming skills through hands-on implementation

🧠 Topics Covered

Arrays & Strings

Searching & Sorting Algorithms

Recursion & Backtracking

Pointers & Memory Concepts

Linked Lists

Stacks & Queues

Trees & Binary Trees

Basic Graph Concepts

Time and Space Complexity Analysis

(Topics are aligned with Semester 2 curriculum and gradually increase in difficulty.)

📈 Progress & Commitment

This repository represents consistency, discipline, and growth.
Even on busy academic days, I aim to push at least one meaningful contribution, reinforcing the habit of showing up and improving daily.

🌱 Learning Philosophy

“Consistency beats intensity.”

This challenge is not just about solving problems, but about:

Writing clean and efficient code

Building strong fundamentals

Developing a long-term problem-solving mindset

🤝 Acknowledgements

Online coding platforms & documentation

Mentors, peers, and open-source community

Continuous feedback and self-reflection

⭐ Final Note

This repository is a reflection of my DSA learning journey, not perfection.
Feedback, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome.
